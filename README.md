# bombsquad-server
Simply dockerize a bombsquad server to make it even easier to setup! I hope this helps people staying at home and safe from COVID-19!

# Server setup
- Make sure you have the server port (default is 43210) open for UDP connections.

# To run:
- install docker and docker-compose on your server
- clone the repo and run the server
```
git clone https://github.com/MohMaz/bombsquad-server.git
cd bombsquad-server
docker-compose up -d
```
